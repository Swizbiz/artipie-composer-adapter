This Java library turns your binary [ASTO](https://github.com/artipie/asto) 
storage into a PHP Composer repository.

## Getting started

This is the dependency you need:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.artipie</groupId>
  <artifactId>composer-adapter</artifactId>
  <version>[...]</version>
</dependency>
```

Save PHP Composer package JSON file like `composer.json` (particular name does not matter)
to [ASTO](https://github.com/artipie/asto) storage.

```java
import com.artipie.asto.*;
Storage storage = new FileStorage(Path.of("/path/to/storage"));
storage.save(
    new Key.From("composer.json"), 
    Files.readAllBytes(Path.of("/my/files/composer.json"))
);
```

Then, make an instance of `Repository` class with storage as an argument.
Finally, instruct `Repository` to add the package to repository:

```java
import com.artipie.composer.*;
Repository repo = new Repository(storage);
repo.add(new Key.From("composer.json"));
```

After that package metadata could be accessed by it's name:

```java
Packages packages = repo.packages(new Name("vendor/package"));
```

Read the [Javadoc](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.artipie/composer-adapter)
for more technical details.
